GLEDOPTO GL-C-0115WL ESP32 WLED Controller  USB Module Pinout


I've put together a quick pinout diagram of the GLEDOPTO GL-C-015WL WLED controller's proprietary daughterboard, using the ESP32-WROOM-32E N4 module. 

This should be helpful for any internal modificationsâ€”like adding an infrared (IR) receiver by tapping into the spare GPIO and 3.3V power rail.
